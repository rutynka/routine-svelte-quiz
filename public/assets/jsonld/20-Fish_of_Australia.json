Like all anemonefishes, it forms a symbiotic mutualism with sea anemones and is unaffected by the stinging tentacles of its host. It is a sequential hermaphrodite with a strict size-based dominance hierarchy; the female is largest, the breeding male is second largest, and the male nonbreeders get progressively smaller as the hierarchy descends. They exhibit protandry, meaning the breeding male changes to female if the sole breeding female dies, with the largest nonbreeder becoming the breeding male.","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/7\/7a\/Amphiprion_latezonatus%2C_Norfolk.jpg","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/7\/7a\/Amphiprion_latezonatus%2C_Norfolk.jpg\/320px-Amphiprion_latezonatus%2C_Norfolk.jpg"}}}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":5,"item":{"@type":"Thing","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Anoplocapros_lenticularis","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/api\/rest_v1\/page\/summary\/Anoplocapros lenticularis","name":"Anoplocapros lenticularis","description":"Anoplocapros lenticularis, the white-barred boxfish, is a species of deepwater boxfish found in Australia.","image":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/2\/24\/Anoplocapros_lenticularis.jpg","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/2\/24\/Anoplocapros_lenticularis.jpg\/320px-Anoplocapros_lenticularis.jpg"}}}},{"@type":"ListItem","position":25,"item":{"@type":"Thing","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blue_groper","sameAs":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/api\/rest_v1\/page\/summary\/Blue groper","name":"Blue groper","description":"Achoerodus is a genus of wrasses collectively known as blue gropers.
